Changelog
=========

0.01 12 Jan 2004
  - Bump up version

0.01_04 27 Dec 2003
  - Some routines just *need* to be able to compute dates that are
    *on or after* instead of just *after* (same for before), so
    tentatively introducing the "on_or_after/before" options

0.01_03 23 Dec 2003
  - Fix silly typo
  - Fix lunar_phase*() functions so that successive calls to next()
    and previous() work as expected.
  - Standardize interface.
  - Change semantics of *_before() and *_after() functions so that
    they always return the "next" applicable date. Pointed out by
    Flavio S. Glock. 
  - Add lunar phases related constants.
  - Add some more tests

0.01_02 19 Dec 2003
